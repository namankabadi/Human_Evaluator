The UK and Danish governments also this week announced plans to curb spending. Italy will take measures to reduce public sector pay and will put a freeze on new recruitment.

The cuts are equal to some 1.6% of gross domestic product (GDP). Similar reductions in spending measures have already been announced by Greece, Spain and Portugal. Heavy price Some Italian workers have already been out protesting. In Rome, workers at the Italian Institute for the Professional Development of Vocational Training of Workers (Isfol) held protests against the cuts at their headquarters. One worker, Simone Casadei, said the public sector had already paid a heavy price. The sector of public research has already paid its toll and suffered cuts in the past, he said. So we are asking for our sector to be left out of the new budget cuts. He added that the money should be raised by getting tough on tax evasion. We also demand that the money needed to face this problems... is obtained through a tough action against tax evasion. The state cannot always take the money from the same sources, that is workers and pensioners. The government hopes to bring its deficit down to below 3% of GDP by 2012 - from 5.3% now - in order to help maintain the confidence of international investors and prevent the spread of a Greek-style debt crisis.

Led by head teacher Dame Sally Coates, the inquiry will report early in 2016. It will also consider the greater use of technology and the direct engagement of employers in shaping prisoners' learning. Prison Reform Trust director Juliet Lyon said: Providing people with the knowledge and skills to help them lead a law-abiding life on release should be a central aim of a modern and effective penal system. Mr Gove said: We have more than 80,000 adults in our custody. One of the most important things we can do once they are inside the prison walls is to make sure that they get the literacy and numeracy skills they need to make them employable and positive contributors to society once released. For those serving longer sentences, education and training is a key part of their rehabilitation. We must have the right incentives for prisoners to learn and for prison staff to make sure that education is properly prioritised. I want to see prisoners motivated to engage in their own learning, and governors with the right tools to be more demanding and creative about the education provided in the prisons they run. I have seen some excellent examples of innovation and visionary organisations providing prisoners with education opportunities and qualifications they actually need to help secure a job on release. But I want to see more. In a speech in July to the Prisoner Learning Alliance, Mr Gove called for an end to the idleness and futility of prison life. He said the inability of prisoners to read properly or master basic mathematics made them prime candidates for reoffending. A system of earned release would be a major change from the current policy where most prisoners are automatically released on licence half way through their sentences.

Nordea Bank's Sasja Beslik told the BBC the protests were just the beginning. People who were worried about climate change did not feel that had many other tools at their disposal, he said. Mr Beslik is in charge of sustainable finance at Nordea, one of the biggest banks in Europe, and the third largest corporation in the Nordic region of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The fund Mr Beslik manages stopped investing in VW after the emissions scandal and no longer authorises the buying of Facebook stock because of concerns over how the company has been addressing its data privacy issues. Speaking to 5 Live's Wake up to Money, he said: I think this [this week's wave of protests] is just the beginning. If we talk about the number of millennials in Europe and in countries all over the world, they are very concerned about the situation and I don't think they feel that they have too many other tools in their hands to approach this. He said the key to forcing companies to change lay not just with grassroots protest, but in the boardroom, because the world's financial sector was the biggest global tool at the table. I think it is fairly obvious that the actions taken by politicians and businesses around the world are not enough, he said, adding: 87% of all the capital in the world is not managed in a way that takes into account climate issues\u2026 If we want to employ the big muscles in the world when it comes to changing the industries\u2026 you need to deploy financial capital.

Sonja Laud, deputy chief investment officer at Legal & General Investment Management, said it was important that investors pushed for change. We've seen a lot more engagement especially when we started with this very public statement that we would actually name those where we feel there is not sufficient progress on a corporate level, she added.

        "InputText": "My business is to fly, says 40-year-old Kiev resident Ruslan Gritsaylo, who really does look like a man who loves his job. Every week he takes customers up in the air on his tiny aircraft known as a paratrike. A cousin of the microlight, paratrikes look like a tricycle tractor with a huge propeller mounted behind, as well as a big parachute which rises into the sky on take-off. At first sight it may be difficult to believe that this vehicle can make it into the air, but these doubts quickly eat the dust when the vehicle breaks away from the earth. Piloting in the blood Mr Gritsaylo is a third generation pilot. His grandfather flew during World War II, and his father was a pilot in the 1970s. He himself flew sports aircraft and was trained as civil aviation pilot. When the Soviet Union ceased to exist, he realised he could make good money by piloting flights on his own. My dear wife Aliona is joking with me: your hobby became a business, and then your business became a hobby. It's all about love, says Mr Gritsaylo. When he started his business in the 1990s, there was not much competition. There was not enough information about paratrikes - how to construct them or how to fly them safely - so it was a rather dangerous business. This changed over time as the technology improved, making flights on the micro-vehicles completely safe and civilised, according to Mr Gritsaylo. It still can be considered as an extreme sport, but it is more about endorphin then adrenalin, he says. It's more about enjoying it rather than being scared of it. The definition of paratrike is one of the safest flying machines ever created by man. Between the lines of the law In a country well-known for its love of red tape, securing permits to fly paratrikes proved complicated. Mr Gritsaylo found that many laws in the aviation sphere contradicted each other, and it was very difficult to properly legalise the business for a small private company. There are lots of things, which make no sense. For example, people come and ask, show me your papers. I say, what kind of papers? and they say, well your pilot licence. I have six pilot licences all over the world, but I don't have Ukrainian, because there is no company legally providing official pilot licences for this kind of ultra-light flying machine, he says. So his biggest problem became his biggest opportunity: because of imperfect legislation his aircraft does not require registration. Otherwise, he would have had to get 11 different permits, which would have been almost impossible. It's a balance between 'yes' and 'no' - it's 'maybe'. And between the borders of this 'maybe', you can do everything. We are between the lines of the law. Mr Gritsaylo carries several thousand customers every year. They stand in line to fly during weekends. Ten minutes in the sky costs about $60 (\u00a337) - for Ukraine, that is quite a lot of money, but he spreads his net wide to catch customers by using social media and maintaining his own website. I follow the rule of big figures - you make lots of calls, lots of e-mails, lots of people. Lots of money, says Mr Gritsaylo, whose phone rings almost every five minutes. AirForia euphoria His clients are made up of a wide range of people - bankers, office managers, artists, actors - and often people buy certificates to fly as gifts for each other. People get their biggest kick from night-flights, otherwise known as open-space flights. Mr Gritsaylo likes to call himself The Man who Brings Happiness. He even named his aero club AirForia, a play on euphoria. He says that after he started taking people up into the sky he needed to diversify his business model, and now he advertises insurance companies and other companies on his parachutes, flying their banners through the skies and performing paratrike tricks during airshows. Take a bottle of milk. How can you earn money with a bottle of milk? Advertise it with an airplane! Where, when, with whom - these are the questions. But every question has an answer. You have to find the connection between the airplane and something you see around. Mr Gritsaylo also purchased equipment so he could produce high-quality videos of the flights. He sets the camera right on the nose of his aircraft and claims that he can take better pictures than helicopters can. Every year you must make some step forward, because there are lots of people walking behind you. And they are trying to step on your toes. If you don't go forward - they will walk on top of you, says Mr Gritsaylo, with a huge smile on his face.",

        "InputText": "Commons Treasury committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said the leak may have damaged consumer confidence. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Friday it would probe the sale of 30 million policies worth \u00a3150bn. It will examine how the news leaked, hitting shares in insurance firms. The inquiry will look at pensions, endowments, investment bonds and life assurance policies sold in the UK between the 1970s and 2000. The FCA had been due to announce the probe in its annual business plan on Monday, but details were revealed ahead of schedule by The Daily Telegraph. Otto Thoreson, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said the story had caused absolute confusion in the investment markets. Mr Tyrie said: On the face of it, this is an extraordinary blunder. It is crucial that we have a full and transparent explanation about how such an apparently serious mistake came to be made by our financial services watchdog - the body appointed by Parliament to enforce high standards of conduct. The principle that market sensitive information is released accurately to all participants at the same time appears to have been breached. 'Uncertainty' Mr Thoreson told the BBC: What happened was effectively a pre-briefing of a business plan which is going to be published on Monday. But because it was to one newspaper, and it was written up as a story without the ability of those of us who are involved in the industry to corroborate issues, what you saw was the uncertainty that was created causing absolute confusion in the investment markets. Later on Friday the FCA issued a statement in response to concerns about how it had handled the release of the news about its investigation. The Board will conduct an investigation into the FCA's handling of the issue involving an external law firm, and will share the outcome of this work in due course, it said. Legal & General, Aviva and Resolution - which owns Friends Provident - were among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, just days after share prices were hit by George Osborne's plans for an overhaul of the UK's pension system and a cap on pension management fees. 'Zombie' funds Formally announcing the inquiry into old policies on Friday, the FCA said it was concerned that some companies were not giving the same priority to policies sold years ago as they did to new policies. A large number of policies sold to consumers in the 30 years to 2000 include terms that penalise those attempting to switch to a cheaper provider. Some savers face losing up to half of their savings if they move to another company. The FCA also said it feared zombie funds, which are closed to new clients, were being used by insurers to pay bills from other parts of their businesses. Details of the inquiry will be officially published on Monday. But concerns that will be covered include: The financial services industry has been scarred by several high-profile scandals during the past few decades involving the mis-selling of policies such as mortgage endowments, personal pensions and payment protection insurance. Millions of endowment policies were sold in the 1980s and 1990s, typically as a method of repaying mortgages, often with unsubstantiated claims that they were guaranteed to pay off the customers' home loan. Millions of pounds were subsequently paid in compensation.",

        "InputText": "By Anthony ReubenHead of statistics The OBR is the independent body set up in 2010 to make economic and fiscal forecasts based on what the government decides to do in its Budgets and Autumn Statements. If you had two major pieces of work to do each year, you would not decide to do one in December and one in March, but that's what the OBR has to do. In its report accompanying the Budget it complained that its already tight timetable had been made harder by government departments handing in their homework at the last minute. We were not given details of costings for a large proportion of significant policy measures until just before our deadlines, the report said. Now, this ranks as a relatively minor whinge, but the gloves came off for the complaints in the OBR's news conference. The trouble is, the OBR has to make forecasts based on how much it thinks the government is going to spend in years for which there are not yet detailed departmental spending plans, which currently applies to the period after April 2016. 'Complex and opaque' It does this based on what's called the medium term spending assumption. And OBR chairman Robert Chote is not best pleased about it. Back in 2011 we could explain the government's spending assumption in our EFO [economic and fiscal outlook] in just 29 words, he told reporters. Users of the BBC News app tap here for the Budget Calculator. It has now become so complicated that it requires 428 words. If you read through it, it is pretty difficult to get your head round, with lots of detail about whether or not it is taking into account the life-length of roads and depreciation for Network Rail. And the problem is that what the government puts in its spending assumption is really important. At the moment, we only have detailed spending plans for the first year of the next parliament. We're relying on the spending assumption to work out spending in the other four. It's unfortunate that this assumption has become so complex and opaque because in an era of fiscally neutral Budget and Autumn Statement scorecards it's become the main mechanism by which the government achieves the outcomes for the Budget balance that it wants to see across the forecast, Robert Chote said. The OBR report shows that the impact of changes to Budget measures are absolutely dwarfed by the effect of changes to the spending assumption. In other words, most of the movements in the forecast come from a complicated set of assumptions for years in which there are no proper spending plans. And to have the head of the OBR condemning parts of the process as opaque is a real problem for the government, which created the OBR to become more transparent and prevent governments from fiddling the figures.",
